<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is an OSGI bundle deployable on [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org/) /
[Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)](https://business.adobe.com/uk/products/experience-manager/adobe-experience-manager.html)
that provides the actions for a
GPT to read the JCR content repository on configured paths. You can use it to direct ChatGPT to read the properties of
JCR nodes and to read the contents of stored files, and answer questions, do summary tasks etc.

This is currently just done as minimal project so that it does what I need it to do. If it doesn't work for you
please contact me - if there is somebody who is interested and willing to provide feedback and share his experiences,
I'll be happy to help and extend it!

Preconditions: To use it you have to be a paying OpenAI ChatGPT customer,
since otherwise GPTs aren't available for you.

Configuration: There is an OSGI configuration "ChatGPT JCR Actions" that
configures the paths to be read, and an required API key for authentication.
The API key should be a long random key
that you can paste both into the configuration and into the authentication section of the GPT, and is responsible for
the security. Additionally there is a number of regular expressions at which read access is permitted. The full path has
to match any of the keys.

To be reachable from ChatGPT it needs to be accessible from the internet via HTTPS. The easiest way I know is using
[serveo.net](https://serveo.net/). You can start it with:

```
ssh -T -R yourdomain.serveo.net:80:localhost:8080 serveo.net
```

Replace `yourdomain` with a prefix of your choice that contains some randomness to avoid collisions and replace 8080
with the port you are using. The servlet
only works if it was configured and is available at the URL /bin/public/gpt/jcractions .

Configure it as actions from a GPT: generally that works like
[GPT creation for Co-Developer GPT Engine](https://codevelopergptengine.stoerr.net/gpt.html) ,
but you have to use the import URL `https://yourdomain.serveo.net/bin/gpt/jcractions.yaml`
and the API key you configured in the OSGI configuration. You can either create a GPT that just has this as actions, or
add this as additional actions to a Co-Developer GPT.

CAUTION: if you do it like that it makes your local server reachable from the internet at `yourdomain.serveo.net`! If
you have proprietary stuff on your server and / or use admin/admin as password, and that worries you, please configure a
reverse proxy or something like that so that only that URL /bin/public/gpt/jcractions is reachable from the internet.
